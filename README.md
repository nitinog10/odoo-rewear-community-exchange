We are working on problem statement no 3.

problem statement overview:
Develop ReWear, a web-based platform that enables users to exchange unused clothing 
through direct swaps or a point-based redemption system. The goal is to promote sustainable 
fashion and reduce textile waste by encouraging users to reuse wearable garments instead of 
discarding them.
