- Tags (optional: “Branded”, “Casual” etc.)

Logic:
- If “Donation” is selected → Item directly added to Donation Pool
- On donation success → User gets +20 fixed points
🤖 5. AI Suggestions Engine (New Feature)
Trigger Points:
- On viewing any item → AI model suggests matching items
  e.g., If user views a White Shirt, system recommends:
  - Brown/Beige trousers
  - Light blue jeans
  - Black belt or shoes

Logic (Backend/Firebase):
- Based on item’s color, type, and category
- Pull similar category items with complementary attributes
- Show in “Suggested Matches” carousel under item detail page
🔄 6. Swap & Points Redemption System
When viewing an item:
Show 3 options:
- Swap Request – User selects one of their items to offer
- Swap + Points – If value mismatch, system calculates gap, asks to pay difference
- Redeem via Points – If user has enough points, direct redemption

Points Logic:
- Upload item → +10 points
- Successful swap → +20 points
- Positive feedback → +5 points
- Referral → +15 points
- Donation → +20 points
- Redeem item → –X points (as per item value)
- Swap + Points → subtract partial points if needed
